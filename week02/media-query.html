      <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
      <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
        commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a
        way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

      <h2>1 Nephi 16:29</h2>
      <p>And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us
        understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to
        the faith and diligence which we gave unto it. And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about
        great things.</p>

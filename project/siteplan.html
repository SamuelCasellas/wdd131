    # Project Subject

    I would like to use this opportunity to create my personal website/portfolio that I can present to recruiters that
    shows the work I have done. This will be critical for when I graduate at the end of this year and need to showcase
    my work.

    I will have a homepage that shows an image of me and my name with dynamic movements and effects, using media queries
    that are appropriate. This will include background information and an executive summary of myself. I will also
    include a tab for projects completed where an html grid will be used to showcase what I have done. and another tab
    for a contact me page with a form where recruiters can contact me.

    For local cache, I will also save the user's preferences for a light or dark theme, as well as caching images for
    reducing load times. Lastly, I will store the users inputs on the form in case the user navigates away from the page
    or encounters an error.

    This is a long-anticipated project and I look forward to implementing it by the end of Week 6!
